Call an API Integrating Redux with React application.



With that programm i use Redux Toolkit to fetch data from a node server in the same file.

I use the simple function way with axios librrary.

Also i use log and error Middleware.


For User Interface i use React.

Aldo I use react-redux library to intergrate redux in react.
For that reason i use useDispatch and useSelector Hooks from react-redux library.
